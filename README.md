##Paper-specific Codes  
###Dynamic functional connectivity in SZ, BD and MDD  
1. Codes are in "**lc\_rsfmri\_tools\_matlab\\Workstation\\code\_workstation2018\_dynamicFC**".   
Download codes: git clone https://github.com/lichao312214129/lc\_rsfmri\_tools\_matlab.git **OR** directly clone from https://github.com/lichao312214129/lc\_rsfmri\_tools\_matlab

2. "**network\_construction**" is used to construct the dynamic and static networks, kmeans clustering and obtain each subject's median network of each state.

3. "**stat**" is used to statistical analysis, such as ANCOVA, post-hoc two-sample t- test, and get shared(common) and distinct(specific) dysconnectivity across these 3 disorders.

4. "**plot**" is used to plot figures for showing the results.
